# MongoDB Data Management App

This repository contains the code and documentation for the MongoDB Data Management App, a Streamlit-based application designed to facilitate efficient data management and manipulation within MongoDB databases. The app provides a user-friendly interface that simplifies various data operations, making it accessible even to those with limited technical expertise.

## Features

- **Intuitive GUI**: A well-designed graphical user interface that enhances the user experience by providing a visual and interactive way to handle data.
- **Data Manipulation Tools**: Includes both manual and automated tools for data manipulation, such as adding, removing, merging columns, and performing conditional updates.
- **SQL Query Execution**: Allows advanced users to execute SQL queries directly on the dataset for complex manipulations.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Changes made to the data can be saved back to MongoDB, ensuring that the modifications are preserved.

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mongodb-data-management-app.git
   cd mongodb-data-management-app
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up MongoDB:**
   Ensure you have access to a MongoDB instance. You'll need to provide your MongoDB connection URI in a `secrets.toml` file.

4. **Create `.streamlit` Folder and `secrets.toml` File:**
   - Create a folder named `.streamlit` in the root directory of your project:
     ```bash
     mkdir .streamlit
     ```
   - Inside the `.streamlit` folder, create a `secrets.toml` file:
     ```bash
     touch .streamlit/secrets.toml
     ```
   - Add your MongoDB URI to the `secrets.toml` file:
     ```toml
     [mongo]
     uri = "your_mongodb_connection_uri"
     ```

5. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run gui_main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Select a Database and Collection**: Start by selecting the database and collection you want to work with.
2. **Load Data**: Click the "Load Data" button to load the data from the selected collection.
3. **Data Operations**: Use the various tools provided in the sidebar to manipulate the data. You can:
   - Add new columns with default values.
   - Remove unnecessary columns.
   - Merge columns.
   - Perform conditional updates.
   - Execute SQL queries on the dataset.
4. **Save Changes**: After making the necessary changes, save your modifications back to MongoDB.

## Workflow Example

1. Select a database and collection from the sidebar.
2. Load the data into the app.
3. Use the "Add Column" or "Remove Column" feature to adjust the data as needed.
4. Apply conditional updates or merge columns to refine the dataset.
5. Run any necessary SQL queries for more complex manipulations.
6. Save the changes to MongoDB.

## Potential Issues and Solutions

- **Data Inconsistency**: Ensure that data validation checks are implemented before applying changes.
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Optimize data processing using efficient algorithms and techniques like indexing.
- **User Errors**: Provide clear instructions and confirmation dialogs before critical operations to prevent mistakes.
- **Security Concerns**: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive data.
- **Compatibility**: Test the application across different environments and maintain compatibility documentation.
